# MLVision API

This is one of the functionalities for the online credit card delivery platform implemented by my team and me for a real bank in Colombia, in the subject of software architecture. 

## Feature
As a customer, given that the system operates normally and faces variations in workload in a non-overloaded environment with 100 concurrent users, I want my information to be validated and be granted a reliability score efficiently to continue with the process. This must be ensured even when the number of concurrent users is increased by 6 times, without the error percentage exceeding 5%.

Acceptance Criteria:

1. The system should be able to handle 100 concurrent users without any performance issues or an increase in error percentage.
2. When the number of concurrent users is increased by 6 times (up to 600 users), the system should still be able to validate customer information and provide a reliability score efficiently, without the error percentage exceeding 5%.
3. The information validation and reliability score assignment process should be fast and responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience.
